# NOTE: DUE TO THE DISCONTINUANCE OF GOOGLE CODE, THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN MOVED TO https://github.com/tomvanbraeckel/amv-codec-tools #

The S1mp3 players ship with often buggy, Microsoft-only GUI's for converting video to the AMV format.

Our goal is to create the tools needed to do the encoding to AMV on all operating systems (including linux), in a much more configurable and scriptable way.

We will use the FFMpeg framework for this to be able to use our AMV-tools with a lot of existing video-related software.

Our convertor is currently in alpha release. Windows and linux users can download a binary of this release on the right - MacOS support coming soon.
