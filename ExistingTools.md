# Demuxers: #

These demuxers are able to take an AMV file and extract the audio and video streams to seperate files. Being able to do this means we know all we need to create a muxer for AMV.

  * Dobrica wrote a Perl-demuxer: http://svn.rot13.org/index.cgi/amv
  * Sang Wei (swkyer@gmail.com) and cbntrt@163.com wrote a C++ decoder and player; available for download in our SVN repositories (see DownloadAndDevelop and http://code.google.com/p/amv-codec-tools/source)


# Muxers: #

A muxer joins audio/video streams together to form an AMV file.

  * AMV Convert Tool: Published by the Chinese company that sells [s1mp3](http://www.s1mp3.org/) players - a bit buggy and only for Windows but it works: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Encoders-Converter-DIVX-Related/AMV-Convert-Tool.shtml
